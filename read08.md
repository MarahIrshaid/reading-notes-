**Comparison operators , evaluating conditions:**
== is equal to ,if the two values are equal just in value no matter the data type is  , true,otherwise : false. </br>
===  strict equal to ,if the two values are equal in both data type and value gives true , otherwise : false.
!= is not equal to ,if the two values are not equal just in value no matter the data type is  , true ,otherwise : false.  </br>
!== is not equal to ,if the two values are not equal  in value or data type   , true ,otherwise : false.  </br>


# pages 156, and 157:

< ,> , >= . <= are comparison operators too.

logical expressions are evaluated form left to right, if the first condition can provide enough information to get the answer, then there is no need to evaluate the second condition.



# pages 170 - 173, and 176:
there is two kinds (and more) of loops in JS, For loop , while loop, like this example :
for loop :
for (i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  text += "The number is " + i + "<br>";
}

while loop :
while (i < 10) {
  text += "The number is " + i;
  i++;
}


there is an initial counter , it checks the condition then if true it runs the code inside the loop then it will be incremented, if false it exits the loop
the difference between for loop and while loop, is that for loop is limited to a number of iterations , but while loop is not.
