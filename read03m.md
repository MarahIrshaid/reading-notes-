## Branching : 
A branch in Git is simply a lightweight movable pointer to one of these commits.
The default branch name in Git is master . As you start making commits,
you're given a master branch that points to the last commit you made. Every time you commit,
the master branch pointer moves forward automatically


## Merging
Merging is Git's way of putting a forked history back together again. 
The git merge command lets you take the independent lines of development created by git branch 
and integrate them into a single branch.


## rebasing
Rebasing replays changes from one line of work onto another in the order they were introduced,
whereas merging takes the endpoints and merges them together
