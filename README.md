 Markdown is a way of writing code just by adding (#) or (*) with text so ot will be transformed into a styled text just like HTML and CSS.
To make bold writing use two stars around the **text** or use __ two underdashes, to make it italic use just one star arount the text *text* or use _ .
 To make heading text, type # hashtag for getting a bigger text (#) This is an <h1> tag, (##) This is an <h2> tag, (######) This is an <h6> tag.
 For emphasis use one star before the text.   or for ordered list use number followed my dot.
