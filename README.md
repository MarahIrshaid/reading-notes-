# What is markdown?
Markdown is a way of writing code just by adding (#) or (*) with text so ot will be transformed into a styled text just like HTML and CSS.
1- To make bold writing use two stars around the **text** or use __ two underdashes, to make it *italic* use just one star arount the text *text* or use _ . </br>
 2- To make heading text, type (#) hashtag for getting a bigger text. type equal number of hashtags as you want it to be in HTML.
 For emphasis use one star before the text.   or for ordered list use number followed my dot. </br>
