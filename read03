# Git in few lines:
Git is a software to manage code and sharing it between teams,Git creates a snapshot of the file and stores a reference to it.
Files in Git can reside in three main states: committed, modified and staged.

***Committed*** :Data is securely stored in a local database.

***Modified*** :File has been changed but not committed to the database.

***Staged*** :Flagged a file’s changed version to be committed in the next snapshot.

## Local Repository Structure

2. Index: The area used for staging
3. Head: Points to the most recent commit
