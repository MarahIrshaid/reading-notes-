# How computers work?

## Summary of video#3 : Binary and data:



Computer works with ones and zeros.



computers represent them using electricity.
\][yt]


with one wire we can represent 1 or 0 , on or off, true or false. these two choices are called a bit, the smaller piece of information a computer can store. with more wires we can store more information.


#### The binary numbers system:
 decimal number system has 0-9 numbers, but binary has 0 or 1 ,two digits only.
 employs 10 digits, each digit position represents a power of 10 (100, 1,000, etc.), in a binary system each digit position represents a power of 2 (4, 8, 16, etc.)
 any number can be represented by ones and zeros.
 with 8 wires , we can store numbers between 0 and 255.
 with 32 wires we can store numbers between 0 and 4 billions!


text ,images , videos and sounds also can be represented in 1's and 0's. its just a sequence of ones and zeros in a particular arrangement.


when you are coding, you do not deal with numbers, you deal with images or sound or video.


## Summary of video#5 : CPU ,Memory , Input and Output:

All computers do the same four things : input information , store them , process them and output them.



**Keyboards are input part** they convert the letter you intered pixel byt pixel to binary sequence and its dilevered to the CPU where it is processed and sent to  memory then to output part.
that and other input data is a huge amount of data so computers now have faster and larger CPUs and memory parts and multiple CPUs are used too.


## summary of video#6 : Hardware and Software:

A computer system consists of two major elements: hardware and software. Computer hardware is the collection of all the parts you can physically touch. Computer software, on the other hand, is not something you can touch. Software is a set of instructions for a computer to perform specific operations.


CPU is the brain of the computer and it uses a particular commands to manage its job, like add command , substract command, store, multiply and move commands.


Nobody now code in binary , it'll take forever! everyone now code using english-like languages like python ,Ruby or blockly.

Software tells the CPU what to do

***An Operating System (OS)*** is an interface between a computer user and computer hardware. An operating system is a software which performs all the basic tasks like file management, memory management, process management, handling input and output, and controlling peripheral devices such as disk drives and printers.
