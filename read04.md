### Navigation :
concise - clear - selective,Using a different
color or some kind of visual marker to indicate the current page ,Each link should be big enough to click on and the appearance of the link should change when the user hovers over each item or clicks on it. It should also be visually distinct from other content on the page , Consistent:  The more pages a site contains, the larger the number of navigation items there will be. Although secondary navigation will change from page to page, it is best to keep the primary navigation exactly the same.
, these things must be followed when designing navigation bar.

**Block elements VS inline elements:**

In general, block level elements are usually structural, while inline elements are usually text based.
**Block elements:**
Some elements will always appear to start on a new line in the browser window. These are known as block level elements. 

Examples of block elements are
<h1>, <p>, <ul>, and <li>.

Some elements will always appear to continue on the same line as their neighbouring elements. These are known as inline elements.
Examples of inline elements are
<a>, <b>, <em>, and <img>

**Grouping Text & Elements In a Block:**
<div>

the <div> tag defines a division or a section in an HTML document. The <div> tag is used as a container for HTML elements - which is then styled with CSS or manipulated with JavaScript. The <div> tag is easily styled by using the class or id attribute

**Grouping Text & Elements Inline**
<span>

**IFrames:**
<iframe>
One common use of iframes  is to embed a Google Map into a page. 
 There are a few attributes that you will need to know to use it:

URL of the page to show in the
frame.
*height*
The height attribute specifies
the height of the iframe in pixels.
*width*
The width attribute specifies
the width of the iframe in pixels
*scrolling* not supported in HTML5
This is important if the page inside the iframe is larger than the space you have allowed for it (using the height and width attributes.
